It is Terrible code.

=> The Same Code is Repeated Again and Again in One function.
=> To make Easyness Resources are available just like for Validation Laravel Request,[NOt USED]
=> Data is Already Once Taken Call to Database Which make the Function Slow.
=> If Somewhere only Id's Needed He take the Whole Object of That Data which is not Good Approch
=> Common Filters are written repeated in if/Else condition for different users of logic which can be put it end only once.
=> Error Handling is not properly Implemented.
=> Exception are Also Not handled.
=> Smart Way of Checking condition not used Just like Ternary Operator.
=> Messages are statically written in Repository which should to be based on the translation.
